			Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
			through some interesting places on the way:
			<ol start="0">		
				<li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
				<li>Magic City, ID</li>
				<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
				<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
				<li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
				<li>Why, AZ</li>
			</ol>

			I saw some Burma Shave style sign on the side of
			the road today:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			Passing cars,<br>
			When you can't see, <br>
			May get you,<br>
			A glimpse,<br>
			Of eternity.<br>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			I definitely
			won't be passing any cars!.

			My first day of the trip! I can't believe finally 
			got everything packed and ready to go. Because
			I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole
			lot with me:
			<ul>
				<li>cellphone</li>
				<li>iPod</li>
				<li>digital camera</li>
				<li>protein bar</li>
			</ul>
			Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would
			have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with
			one Segway.</q> The &lt;html&gt; element rocks.
			Secret location: &#208;&epsilon;&tau;&#114;&ouml;&igrave;&tau;.
