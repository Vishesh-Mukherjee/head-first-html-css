		<h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
		<p>
			Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

		<h2>September 17, 2005</h2>
		<p>
			Today's weather is quite nice actually. 
			Have been travelling for a while now 
			but still can't get enough of this.

			Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
			through some interesting places on the way:
		</p>
		<ol>		
			<li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
			<li>Magic City, ID</li>
			<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
			<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
			<li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
			<li>Why, AZ</li>
		</ol>

		<h2> July 14, 2005</h2>
		<p>
			I saw some Burma Shave style sign on the side of
			the road today:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Passing cars,<br />
				When you can't see, <br />
				May get you,<br />
				A glimpse,<br />
				Of eternity.<br />
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			I definitely
			won't be passing any cars!.
		</p>

		<h2> June 2, 2005</h2>
		<p>
			<img alt="Day 1 image" src="images/img1.jpeg" />
		</p>
		<p>
			My first day of the trip! I can't believe finally 
			got everything packed and ready to go. Because
			I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole
			lot with me:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>cellphone</li>
			<li>iPod</li>
			<li>digital camera</li>
			<li>protein bar</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would
			have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with
			one Segway.</q> The &lt;html&gt; element rocks.
			Secret location: &#208;&epsilon;&tau;&#114;&ouml;&igrave;&tau;.
